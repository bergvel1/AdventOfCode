# AdventOfCode
Solutions to the Advent of Code programming puzzles.

To use, set the `SESSION_ID` environment variable before running `util.Runner.main()`. See [here](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code/issues/1) for info on how to find your `SESSION_ID`.

Set the `AOC_VERBOSE` environment variable to `false` to disable error output.
